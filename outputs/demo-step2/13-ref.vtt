West Brom so far beaten 3-0 at home by Manchester City.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And Tony Pulis, the head coach, conceded they were far too open.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Solid display and a 0-0 draw at Watford last weekend.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the team that finished 13th in the league last season, here's Rondon, Terry with him, oh it's gone Rondon's way, now John Terry in trouble, Mark Clattenburg to his pocket, it is red, he got yellow out to start with by accident, John Terry is sent off for the sixth time in his Chelsea career.
