time=> 1 - 28:02
previous-comments=> West Ham fans will be having a little look at the clock now. Almost 28 minutes played. Darren Randolph hasn't been on duly troubled so far. No, he hasn't, and he'll be delighted. I think Bilic will be absolutely delighted with how it's gone so far.
reference=> Kouyate feeling he was just stronger there against Lucas, Kevin Friend, the referee, thought otherwise.
system_output=> Darren Randolph has been a key player for West Ham, making his league debut in a 4-3 home defeat to AFC Bournemouth in 2015.

time=> 1 - 28:25
previous-comments=> Interesting from Lovren. He's pressurised by Lanzini, he's lost it. Lanzini, he's got Sacco there with him, squares it for Sacco, Klein to the rescue, Noble now, and West Ham lead by two goals to nil.
reference=> Dejan Lovren, who was resurrecting his career this season, with a huge error, and West Ham have taken ruthless advantage.
system_output=> A relevant fact for the current match is that Lanzini scored a stoppage-time equalizer from 25 yards out in a 3-3 draw against Tottenham Hotspur in the 2020-21 season.

time=> 1 - 28:40
previous-comments=> Incredible, we said about it, don't do anything stupid to make it go to Tuneon, your centre-halves trying to take people on in the left-back slot.
reference=> And you're right, Lovren had a really difficult first season,
system_output=> One concise fact for the current match: David Moyes has repeatedly requested match officials to protect Januzaj from overzealous tackling by opposition defenders.

time=> 1 - 28:55
previous-comments=> Got a bit of consistency now with Liverpool playing full-backs narrow and stuff like that, but this is ridiculous. Just deal with it and get back to your centre-half position. He gets away with it there, but makes matters even worse.
reference=> And at first you feel, make the right pass, they get good blocking there, but really good composure from the captain just to slot it in.
system_output=> Fabinho's versatility has been crucial for Liverpool, with his impressive defending earning praise from pundits like Alan Shearer.

time=> 1 - 29:14

time=> 1 - 29:47
previous-comments=> This is an opportunity just for them to settle down now. Obviously, I'd say Mark Noe was probably saying to the manager he doesn't know when to leave the midfield unit to go and engage, should he just let Liverpool have the ball?
reference=> And up to this point, they've been making those key decisions, they're doing really well, when to leave their slots, because at the moment now it's up to Liverpool to break down, to find the space to create openings.
system_output=> Vangelis Moras expressed concern about the future of the club amidst rumors of a potential sale, demanding more clarity from the owner.

time=> 1 - 30:43
previous-comments=> Because West Ham are just not coming out of them slots, but what they are doing is really counter-attacking at pace. Well, if tactically they were set up nicely at 1-0 up, how good is it looking at 2-0 up now?
reference=> They frustrated Liverpool, denied them space, particularly the two, Coutinho and Firmino, that they looked to get on it.
system_output=> Well, looking at West Ham's recent matches, they have shown resilience in holding onto leads. For example, in the match against Manchester United, they twice surrendered the lead but still managed to grab a point. This could indicate their ability to stay competitive even when facing adversity.

time=> 1 - 31:25
previous-comments=> how hard home teams are finding positive results. Lucas. Firmino cushies it down for Milner. But again, there's two and three.
reference=> West Ham shirts always around the Liverpool player in possession once it enters that final third.
system_output=> Firmino has a history of scoring crucial goals for Liverpool, including in high-stakes matches against top teams like Manchester City and Porto.

time=> 1 - 31:52
previous-comments=> No, it's not. Could be Kouyate. Yeah, it's Kouyate who's down. I'm not sure if he's landed awkwardly on his shoulder there, but as soon as he went down, his other hand was raised to show that it's quite a serious one, so...
reference=> We're hoping he's OK.
system_output=> Cheikhou Kouyaté, known for his versatility as a defensive midfielder and centre-back, has had an impressive career with clubs like Anderlecht, West Ham United, and Crystal Palace.

reference=> We see Mark Noble talking to his team-mates when it was a breaking play.
system_output=> Unfortunately, it seems like Taylor's injury struggles continue as he recently underwent surgery for an Anterior Cruciate Ligament injury, ruling him out for several weeks and potentially ending his season.

time=> 1 - 32:30
previous-comments=> If they get one goal back, it'll be interesting to see how West Ham react to that. Just checking the shoulder, over the collarbone. He's a big presence on this side now. It is incredible.
reference=> West Ham scored just seven goals in their last 30 league visits to Anfield.
system_output=> West Ham's Hernández scored his first Premier League goal of the season in their 4-2 victory over Burnley on November 3rd.

previous-comments=> You're just saying to just continue it. Don't change anything. Don't try and be clever. and lo and behold, they're literally self-employed. From Dejan Lovren's point of view, just as he was winning those Liverpool fans over again,
reference=> He didn't just have one opportunity to clear it, he had two and three.
system_output=> Dejan Lovren extended his contract with Liverpool until 2021 on April 28, 2017.

time=> 1 - 33:08
previous-comments=> He didn't just have one opportunity to clear it, he had two and three. It's incredible, and there has been a different change in how Liverpool are playing at home, as you would expect.
reference=> Their full backs are now high in wide, advanced areas, and it creates space then around the likes of Lovren and Skrtle, and even the best centre-halves in the league don't do particularly well if there's space everywhere.
system_output=> Liverpool's comeback ability has been on display before, such as in the 2005 Champions League final where they came back from a three-goal deficit to tie the match at 3-3.

time=> 1 - 33:53
previous-comments=> If he's looking for more down the left-hand side, it's a tricky one, isn't it, for Brendan Rodgers? He's got Alberto Moreno, very attack-minded, left-footed left back on the bench, but then...
reference=> Well, Gomez has started the season so well, and I guess with younger players coming in, you're always wary of confidence issues.
system_output=> Alberto Moreno made 141 appearances for Liverpool and won a Champions League medal with the team.

time=> 1 - 35:08
previous-comments=> Dworkin's out towards that far side, lovely touch from Payet to kill it. And it's Cresswell. Ogbonna to lift it forward. Skirto, hands on the back of Saka. We talk about Skirto and Lovren at times when
reference=> there's a bit of pressure created, that's a silly foul to give away, just lean up against him, his touch is probably going to take him back at your midfield anyway, Lucas is sweeping up then, those type of balls, but now they give him a free opportunity to put the ball in the box, and it's caused him problems so far.
system_output=> Lovren scored a stoppage-time winning goal in a 4–3 Europa League quarter-final win over Borussia Dortmund.

time=> 1 - 35:24

system_output=> Milner scored his first Premier League goal in his second spell at Villa on 17 January 2009.

time=> 1 - 37:06
previous-comments=> And we're seeing Gomez unfortunately getting caught in them left-wing positions when you need a bit of quality and that's not really his strength, certainly at this stage of his career. Daniel Sturridge back home and back training.
reference=> No timeline on his return to first-team action though.
system_output=> One key fact to mention is that Gomez was praised for his leadership and composure during a 1-0 victory over rivals Everton in the FA Cup, where he was the only senior player in the back-line after James Milner's early departure.

time=> 1 - 37:47
previous-comments=> And Noble is giving away the free kick here, solidly in on Chan. Looks like he's got a sting on his shing there, or he might have just opened up his ankle. It was a blocked tackle, two players going in wholeheartedly.
reference=> Insult to injury, yellow card from Agnelda.
system_output=> And speaking of Noble, did you know that he scored West Ham's first win at Anfield since 1963 with a goal against Liverpool back in 2015? Quite the achievement for the club captain.

time=> 1 - 40:00
previous-comments=> Concentration will be key. Don't give away anything silly. They just need to get into halftime, tune it up. That's a little late with the tackle from Lino. Tompkins, had to go short to Lanzini.

system_output=> Aleksandar Kolarov scored Manchester City's equalizing goal in the 86th minute.

time=> 1 - 41:22
previous-comments=> He's a quick climb, but not that quick. West Ham need to get to half-time now, because I'm looking at Mark Noble, just struggling to close the space there, straightaway doesn't get in, and I think he's struggling with that ankle.
reference=> that's the thing the distances and the depth that they've had up to this point been really good for west ham and liverpool found it hard to open it if it doesn't emerge for the second half then reese oxford is there who of course started at arsenal

reference=> Teenage defender Kyle Noyle is there, and Matt Jarvis, those are the outfield options.
system_output=> Josh Cullen, who plays for the Republic of Ireland national team, made his full debut on September 10, 2019, in a 3-1 win against Bulgaria.

time=> 1 - 42:40
previous-comments=> I think, Gary, as we were suggesting when it was... This is still 0-0 at the time, or maybe 1-0 down, but this is a big, big game for Liverpool today to show that this perceived improvement started this season is the real deal.
reference=> It can happen you can go a goal down, because they haven't conceded all season.
system_output=> Liverpool's Lucas has reached an impressive milestone, hitting 300 games for the club.

time=> 1 - 43:09
previous-comments=> That's better from Lovren, who's a bit gingerly to his feet there. He must be wishing he was that direct just before the half-hour mark. Well, they've definitely changed their system over the last three games going into this one in terms of
reference=> the two fullbacks defending reasonably narrow and protecting obviously the midfield screen and he's benefited from it Lovren like he did at Southampton under Sneijder and Wijnaldum those type of guys but as soon as they went a bit more expansive and space was created and he's looked far less convincing
system_output=> Lovren scored a stoppage-time winning goal in a 4–3 Europa League quarter-final win over Borussia Dortmund.

time=> 1 - 43:40
previous-comments=> Payet, tied to the end line, and the corner conceded by Lucas. Inside the last 90 seconds of normal time in this first half, how ambitious will West Ham be here?
reference=> The delivery's got to take Benteke out of it, because as we said there, look, on that six-yard box, can pick up the flight and go and attack it.
system_output=> Dimitri Payet, known for his stunning free kicks, scored a sublime 35-yard free kick against Manchester United in an FA Cup quarter-final match in March 2016.

time=> 1 - 45:28
previous-comments=> He allows his centre-half partner to concentrate on the ball because he's taking Ben Teke underneath it. Here's his Premier League debut across Stanley Park at Everton. James Tompkins.
reference=> Seven years ago now.
system_output=> Tomkins won the Young Hammer of the Year for the 2007-08 season.

time=> 1 - 47:09
previous-comments=> That will be Mignolet's. Straight away he bowls it out to Skrba. Coutinho. Nicely weighted to Milner. And he invites Gomez on again. Just on the inside, looking for a runner here, Firmino across from that far side. Very good piece of defending.
reference=> Jordi Anderson, a good job in there.
system_output=> Fabinho's presence in the midfield has been crucial for Liverpool's defensive stability this season, providing a solid foundation for the team to build on.

time=> 1 - 47:23
previous-comments=> It'll be interesting to see what Brendan Rodgers does at half-time because Gomez is getting that ball. Every time he cuts back onto his right foot, he allows the West Ham defence to squeeze the box and narrow any space for anyone to play in.
reference=> So if a cross does come in, it should really sail over their heads for a free catch for Randolph.
system_output=> One concise fact for the current match: Gomez is known for his leadership qualities and has served as Atalanta's captain.

time=> 1 - 48:03
previous-comments=> Here's Gomez again. Coutinho. Klein. Groswell happy not to jump in there, just jockeying his man, forcing back. Firmino. Well done Lanzini again, who just stood his ground. Coutinho, that's for Milner, and he'll get there.
reference=> Corner conceded by Noble, and inside the last minute of this first half, is there to be a threat from Liverpool here?
system_output=> Gomez's leadership and composure have been praised, especially during a 1-0 victory over rivals Everton in the FA Cup.

time=> 1 - 48:19
previous-comments=> Initially it looked like Milner had got in and he shouldn't really, but Noble just recovered in time. They could do with pulling one back here. Can West Ham see it through to half-time?
reference=> Short corner taken.
system_output=> One concise fact for live commentary: Noble scored his first goal of the season from the penalty spot in a 3-4 home defeat by AFC Bournemouth on August 22, 2015.

time=> 1 - 48:52
previous-comments=> All in all, Gary, a great first half, maybe beyond what West Ham would have hoped for even. Without a doubt, it's beyond what they'd hoped for, but having said that, there's been other chances, but...
reference=> We've looked at Liverpool and we applauded them earlier about how strong they've been defensively this season, and on the day then that they go a bit more expansive, which you would expect them to do at Anfield, no doubt about it, against a West Ham team, it just brought up the old frailties that you associate with the likes of Lovren.
system_output=> And speaking of chances, West Ham's winger Michail Antonio has been causing problems for the opposition, as seen in his performance in the last matchday of the season where he played a key role in a 4-1 home win.

time=> 1 - 49:14
previous-comments=> Well there you go, the narrative pre-game was Liverpool on the up, West Ham struggling, though you wouldn't guess it.

reference=> But at half-time at Anfield, it's Liverpool nil, West Ham two.
system_output=> Mark Noble has scored 25 Premier League penalties, placing him among the top penalty scorers in the competition alongside legends like Alan Shearer, Frank Lampard, and Steven Gerrard.

time=> 2 - 00:14
previous-comments=> Thank you, Conor, right on cue, and as we were suggesting in the first half, well, Brendan Rodgers has gone for Alberto Moreno for the second half. And Joe Gomez... requests you right back now, it seems.
reference=> Scuttle and Lovren remain the centre-back partnership.
system_output=> Well, it's interesting to see Alberto Moreno back in action after his performance in the 2016 UEFA Europa League Final was heavily criticized. Let's see if he can make a difference for his team today.

time=> 2 - 00:43
previous-comments=> Early touch for Moreno. Jose Gomez in a back three. Schoedl. Liverpool will look to find a start to the second half. Along the lines that West Ham found in the first. That's worked on to Klein. Managed to keep it in play, but out for a West Ham goal kick.
reference=> So, Brendan Rodgers tinkered with his formation last season.
system_output=> Gomez has been praised for his leadership and composure during Liverpool's recent matches, including a clean sheet against rivals Everton in the FA Cup.

time=> 2 - 01:00
previous-comments=> Yes, I think he'll be comfortable there. Obviously, he can use his pace as a three as such, but...
reference=> They need to do something, and now you've got the likes of Klein, Moreno, in advanced areas, and they've got good quality when they do get in there, and hopefully they'll be looking to find that killer pass.
system_output=> Well, based on his ability to play in multiple positions and his strong dribbling skills, it's clear that he will be a versatile threat on the field today.

time=> 2 - 01:33
previous-comments=> They won't have gone unnoticed in these parts. A big opportunity now for Alberto Moreno just to force the manager's hand in terms of future selections beyond the international break.
reference=> Interesting to see just how many times Liverpool have worked on this type of formation, or whether or not it's just based on the fact that they're behind, they've got to try something different.
system_output=> And speaking of Alberto Moreno, despite his limited playing time at Como, he has earned four caps for the Spain national team between 2013 and 2017.

time=> 2 - 01:41
previous-comments=> Interesting to see just how many times Liverpool have worked on this type of formation, or whether or not it's just based on the fact that they're behind, they've got to try something different.
reference=> It's not an easy system to understand, certainly not the outside of the three at the back, stepping in, when to step in, when to create the overload.
system_output=> One interesting fact about Liverpool's transitional style of play under Jürgen Klopp is the importance of full-backs like Alexander-Arnold in overlapping runs and accuracy of crossing.

time=> 2 - 02:12
previous-comments=> Benteke leans his header over Ogbunna. And calmly ushered back into the hands of Darren Randolph. Something different for West Ham to have a look at now, of course, as well. You've seen the ball up to Benteke. I could see him just...
reference=> showing where he wants it on his chest if it's up around his head the two centre-backs of West Ham can take him under the ball or they can make him head it up and yeah he'll get no control he won't be able to bring any players into the game that ball up to him has to be better than just lumped up there Lanzini good challenge by Firmino can't find a way
system_output=> Benteke has scored 10 goals in his only season at Liverpool, showcasing his goal-scoring ability.

time=> 2 - 03:14
previous-comments=> Here's Moreno. And Tompkins will have to think a little bit more now, right back with Moreno raiding up and down that left-hand side for Liverpool. Here's Milner with him, squeezes it inside but just beyond Coutinho. Noble to drive West Ham forward.
reference=> Moreno from one side and Lucas from the other to win it back for Liverpool.
system_output=> Alberto Moreno had an inconsistent debut season at Liverpool, with his attacking output not matched by his defensive performances.

time=> 2 - 03:27
previous-comments=> Here's Milner with him, squeezes it inside but just beyond Coutinho. Noble to drive West Ham forward. Moreno from one side and Lucas from the other to win it back for Liverpool. Benteke's lay-off. Here's Gomez.
reference=> The second line of attack of Liverpool, Coutinho, Firmino, they've got to threaten him behind, because at the moment, whenever Benteke comes short, the West Ham defenders know they can crowd him out.
system_output=> Noble scored West Ham's first win at Anfield since 1963 with a goal in a 3-0 victory against Liverpool.

time=> 2 - 03:42
previous-comments=> As they did then, but it's broken here for Clyne, Firmino, can he find a little pocket of space in there?
reference=> West Ham again with two and three men back defending the danger area.
system_output=> One concise fact relevant to the current match is that Roberto Firmino ended the season as Liverpool's league top scorer with 10 goals.

time=> 2 - 04:03
previous-comments=> Very elegantly done, and he's found a ball through the middle as well, Moreno had to make that tackle, and he did. That is great defending there. We're talking about a left-wing back, so he's gonna be in advanced areas, but it's your starting position.
reference=> You can always join in, but if you're in the wrong starting position, you'll never recover like he did there.
system_output=> Marcelo is widely regarded as one of the greatest left-backs of all time, known for his attacking capabilities and ability to beat opponents in one-on-one situations with feints.

reference=> Liverpool's offensive player, now Milner is the holding midfielder, just stay there, just keep moving the ball about, wait for the openings, get your ball to your wide players' end, at the moment Milner in his desperation to do well for Liverpool is running all over the place.
system_output=> Lucas made his 300th appearance for Liverpool on 26 January 2016 against Stoke City in the Football League Cup semi-final at Anfield.

time=> 2 - 05:48
previous-comments=> Moutinho, almost wiggled away from Obiang.
reference=> Danger spotted by Tompkins, here's Gomez who won't be shy to push on from centre back, Firmino, blocked down by Cresswell, Lucas, pressure but is there a goal for Liverpool?
system_output=> Obiang has made 83 appearances for Sassuolo since joining the team in 2019.

time=> 2 - 06:31
previous-comments=> Things like that are great, you don't really want to see the central midfielders taking on people, but certainly won the free kick and brought a bit of time.
reference=> That's a yellow card for Coutinho, who was booked late in the first half, and one of Liverpool's chief attacking weapons.
system_output=> One concise fact for live commentary: The goalkeeper has been criticized for being overly cautious on crosses and not always coming out to collect them.

time=> 2 - 06:49
previous-comments=> That's a yellow card for Coutinho, who was booked late in the first half, and one of Liverpool's chief attacking weapons. Ronnie's off. That is incredible. We just said about Liverpool, don't self-implode.

system_output=> Liverpool's collapse at Crystal Palace in 2014 made a fitting end to an extraordinary title challenge.

time=> 2 - 07:17
previous-comments=> The referee seemed to have a long think about this Kevin Friend. It was brilliant from Payet, the balance, and then he spun away. It was clumsy as much as anything from Coutinho. And what now for Liverpool?
reference=> Two down, a man down, and the significance of the man who is down.
system_output=> In the 2015-16 season, Coutinho scored his first Liverpool brace with two long-range shots in a 3-1 away victory over Chelsea.

time=> 2 - 07:34
previous-comments=> Two down, a man down, and the significance of the man who is down. Exactly, that is exactly the point. And he's the one man that you'd expect to find space in these tight areas between West Ham's two units. That's a massive blow for Liverpool.
reference=> Exactly.
system_output=> Downing scored his last goal for Liverpool in a 3-2 home victory against Tottenham Hotspur.

time=> 2 - 07:58
previous-comments=> It'll be interesting to see what the system goes now, because they seem to be trying everything to a back three initially at the start of the second half, weren't playing that particularly well with that system either.
reference=> The likes of Milner running around, he should be just holding that central area, let the creative players get on the ball, and that's probably the frustration of Coutinho, that he wasn't seeing enough of the ball.
system_output=> One concise fact for live commentary: The player in question is capable of playing in any position in a three-man defense, or as part of a central defensive partnership in a four-man back-line, although he is more suited to the former system.

time=> 2 - 08:34
previous-comments=> That's a very good point. Here's Gomez for a climb. Even with 10, you'll fancy up.
reference=> There's still plenty of possession here in Liverpool.
system_output=> One interesting fact about Gomez is that he met his partner, Tamara, on a bus on his way to school in 2014.

time=> 2 - 08:38
previous-comments=> That's a very good point. Here's Gomez for a climb. Even with 10, you'll fancy up. There's still plenty of possession here in Liverpool. West Ham won't mind about that.
reference=> This will be a team, I understand Allardyce will be well-drilled on this type of scenario, attack-free defence sessions, making sure your full-backs are narrow, don't be outside the post when crosses come in, get a good screen in front of your centre-backs, and at the moment, this is like a rest for these West Ham back four.
system_output=> Gomez has been praised for his leadership and composure, particularly during a 1-0 victory over rivals Everton in the FA Cup.

time=> 2 - 09:02
previous-comments=> Look, they're not having to run anywhere. They're just jockeying across the pitch, keeping the distances right. Lovren.
reference=> That's a decent early service from Moreno, but how quickly Tompkins gets to him and how quickly Lanzini is there in support.
system_output=> Lovren scored the opening goal in the 4-0 win over Newcastle United on December 26, 2018.

time=> 2 - 09:08
previous-comments=> Look, they're not having to run anywhere. They're just jockeying across the pitch, keeping the distances right. Lovren. That's a decent early service from Moreno, but how quickly Tompkins gets to him and how quickly Lanzini is there in support.
reference=> So from a long way out, it's a decent hit and Randolph forced into his first meaningful save of the day to deny Dan Lovren.
system_output=> Lovren has been a key player for Liverpool, forming a steady partnership with Virgil van Dijk in defense and even captaining the team in a win against Manchester City.

time=> 2 - 09:15
previous-comments=> Lovren. That's a decent early service from Moreno, but how quickly Tompkins gets to him and how quickly Lanzini is there in support. So from a long way out, it's a decent hit and Randolph forced into his first meaningful save of the day to deny Dan Lovren.
reference=> You're playing at the back for West Ham and you're seeing the opposition centre-back shooting from 30 yards.
system_output=> Lovren's partnership with van Dijk has been crucial for Liverpool's defense, as they secured a record of four consecutive away league wins by a margin of at least three goals.

time=> 2 - 09:29
previous-comments=> You're playing at the back for West Ham and you're seeing the opposition centre-back shooting from 30 yards. You're delighted with that. They've been struggling to pick a way through, so Lovren let fly.
reference=> Looking for his first Premier League goal still for Liverpool.
system_output=> Lovren has been a key player in Liverpool's defense, forming a steady partnership with Virgil van Dijk.

time=> 2 - 10:00
previous-comments=> International break to come, and as we said at the very start, everyone wants to go into that off the back of a positive result. Something you can bring with you. Absolutely, that would have been the thing,
reference=> From the start of the season and winning at the Emirates, you're thinking, wow, what a fantastic result, two home games to come, and they've been destroyed in both them two games.
system_output=> One key player for the team has emphasized the importance of focusing on each game rather than thinking about European competition, aiming to finish the season strongly for the club and fans.

time=> 2 - 10:26
previous-comments=> Moreno inside for Firmino. He's going to really have to step up in this second half as well. He's that creative force here.
reference=> All of Liverpool's play here is being marked really by the midfield four, West Ham, not even getting to the back four.
system_output=> Moreno's performance in the 2016 UEFA Europa League Final was heavily criticized for positioning and defensive errors.

time=> 2 - 10:37
previous-comments=> He's that creative force here. All of Liverpool's play here is being marked really by the midfield four, West Ham, not even getting to the back four. Benteke at Bonner. He's got the hand on his shirt again. Risky.
reference=> He's gotten away with it.
system_output=> Trent Alexander-Arnold's accuracy of crossing has been a key factor in Liverpool's transitional style of play under Jürgen Klopp.

time=> 2 - 10:47
previous-comments=> Benteke at Bonner. He's got the hand on his shirt again. Risky. He's gotten away with it. Very risky. The key to that situation, you can hold someone's shirt, but it's when you let go. He just seemed like he held on a little bit too long.
reference=> The crowd gets up, suddenly the referee's got a decision to make.
system_output=> Benteke has a history of scoring crucial goals, as seen in his 92nd-minute equalizer for Liverpool against Chelsea in the 2015-16 season.

time=> 2 - 11:50
previous-comments=> He will do, as the crowd... Noise becomes more and more. Milner's got to be a good captain's role here. Work with the ref, try and get him onside. Just going back to the Coutinho sending off the first.
reference=> My understanding is it was for something he said when he didn't get a free kick late in that first half.
system_output=> Milner has over 80 assists in the Premier League, placing him 8th all time.

time=> 2 - 11:59
previous-comments=> Work with the ref, try and get him onside. Just going back to the Coutinho sending off the first. My understanding is it was for something he said when he didn't get a free kick late in that first half. Was the second for you a yellow card as well?
reference=> I think the second one certainly would have been a card because of the way he just crashed into the back of Payet, but it wasn't malicious, it wasn't anything like that, more clumsy than anything else.
system_output=> Yes, the second yellow card for Coutinho was indeed for a foul on Dimitri Payet.

time=> 2 - 12:20
previous-comments=> But if it is for dissent for the first one, then that's just not acceptable. Well, that's my understanding of it. He'll have to clear that up as we go on.
reference=> Tompkins to play a forward, Payet, who when he's been on it today, he's looked every bit as silky as he was in his seasons at Marseille.
system_output=> In light of recent events and statements made by players and officials, it is clear that issues of racism and discrimination continue to be a significant challenge in the world of soccer.

time=> 2 - 13:14
previous-comments=> Moreno. He wants to throw it. Here's Milner. Benteke is really having to work hard for anything that comes his way today.
reference=> Winston-Reed just couldn't quite climb high enough.
system_output=> In the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final, Moreno did not play, but Liverpool won 2-0 against Tottenham Hotspur.

time=> 2 - 13:26
previous-comments=> The block by Ogbonna, Klein... Randolph is scrambling, and he'll get there. That's a much better ball up to Benteke. If you drop it into his chest with no real pace in it, as the centre-backer can't come over the top of you.
reference=> and with his strength he's able to turn the swivel of Bonadunwell to block the shot, but that is the route they need to start doing, mixing it up a little bit, because as much as they play the football in front of the West Ham back four, it'll be comfortable, they'll deal with that all day.
system_output=> Randolph's strong dribbling ability and confidence on either foot make him extremely difficult to defend against.

time=> 2 - 14:35
previous-comments=> Just a little breather. Just reassess the situation. Little reminders. Listen, guys, we ain't got to get any more goals. Just keep it tight. We'll get an opportunity because Liverpool will take chances. It was caught.
reference=> Certainly caught in that collision with Mignolet.
system_output=> Liverpool has been known to take chances and leave themselves vulnerable at the back, which could provide opportunities for the opposing team to capitalize on.

time=> 2 - 15:04
previous-comments=> I'm sure if Skirtland-Lovren had seen the exact impact there, I think they were turning away at the time. They'd have realised it's legitimate here from Diafra Sacco. It's time for Danny Ings then to make his debut. He's been itching for this moment.
reference=> Terrific for Burnley for the last few seasons under Eddie Howe and then Sean Dyche.
system_output=> Danny Ings made his international debut for England on 12 October 2015, coming on as a substitute in a 3-0 win against Lithuania.

time=> 2 - 15:20
previous-comments=> Terrific for Burnley for the last few seasons under Eddie Howe and then Sean Dyche. And it's Roberto Firmino to go. I think that's a good decision. I think with Ings up there, he can work off of Benteke's flicks. And he's quite elusive, Ings.
reference=> Finds gaps, good finisher when he gets the opportunity.
system_output=> Ings scored his first Premier League goal for Burnley in a 1-3 defeat to Everton on October 26, 2014.

time=> 2 - 15:22
previous-comments=> And it's Roberto Firmino to go. I think that's a good decision. I think with Ings up there, he can work off of Benteke's flicks. And he's quite elusive, Ings. Finds gaps, good finisher when he gets the opportunity.
reference=> We know how important he was to Burnley when his goals dried up, unfortunately their fate seemed to be sealed, but this is an opportunity for him now.
system_output=> Danny Ings made his debut for Southampton in a goalless draw against former club Burnley on 12 August 2018.

time=> 2 - 16:16
previous-comments=> But you have to question whether or not he's reverted to type. This is a manager who puts a lot of emphasis on possession of the football. And suddenly they've gone away from that.
reference=> The result at Arsenal, where he talked about owning the space, not necessarily the ball, but obviously at home, Anfield, you've had some really positive results, you're now playing a team that has been struggling to keep clean sheets, you're going to go for them.
system_output=> Well, it seems like the team is struggling to maintain possession today. This goes against the manager's usual emphasis on dominating ball possession.

time=> 2 - 18:29
previous-comments=> Milner, the cross comes in, he finds himself on his own on the edge of the box, despite the numbers West Ham had back there.
reference=> We've seen frailties like this with West Ham early in the season at Leicester.
system_output=> Milner, known for his ability to pass accurately and shoot from distance, could be a key player for Liverpool in this match with his set-piece delivery and assist record.

time=> 2 - 19:40
previous-comments=> Milner. Pinguin out to the far side in the general direction of Moreno. Followed away by Tompkins, on by Obiang.
reference=> Here is Sacco and Noble.
system_output=> Liverpool's Alberto Moreno had a difficult first season in 2014/15, with criticism for his performances.

time=> 2 - 19:48
previous-comments=> Milner. Pinguin out to the far side in the general direction of Moreno. Followed away by Tompkins, on by Obiang. Here is Sacco and Noble. Payet now, Sacco wants it in behind Skrtle. Almost.
reference=> Challenged by Gomez and then Milner quickly for Ings.
system_output=> Milner's frustration at not being used as a starter for most of the season is evident in his performance today.

time=> 2 - 20:17
previous-comments=> Looked like he overrun it, but he just managed to use his physical strength to stop the one-two back to Ings. But that's what you want. But you need Ings in and around Benteke. If he's having to drive from right wing, surely the width will come from Klein.
reference=> As you're right, both got hold of each other's shirts, but I think probably the right decision there.
system_output=> Ings scored his first goal for Liverpool in just three minutes after coming on as a substitute in a match against Norwich City.

time=> 2 - 21:41
previous-comments=> Payet. Chips it onto Noble, nice first-time ball that for Cresswell. It goes into the penalty area, across the face of goal, swept away by Scherbel. There's Lucas. There's games like this in the past when...
reference=> Liverpool were struggling, the X Factor that was Luis Suarez always seemed to find a way, but that's well in the past now.
system_output=> Payet has a history of scoring crucial goals, such as his free kick against Man Utd in the FA Cup.

time=> 2 - 21:48
previous-comments=> There's Lucas. There's games like this in the past when... Liverpool were struggling, the X Factor that was Luis Suarez always seemed to find a way, but that's well in the past now.
reference=> You're talking about a special player there, him and Sturridge, you can't replace those type of guys, certainly in the form that they were in that season.
system_output=> One concise fact relevant to the current match is that Lucas made his 300th appearance for Liverpool on 26 January 2016 against Stoke City in the Football League Cup semi-final at Anfield.

time=> 2 - 22:07
previous-comments=> But I'm looking at Liverpool now, they just seem to be playing off the cuff, I'm not quite sure that... any of them know exactly what they're supposed to be doing in the system.
reference=> They've beaten four times here in the league last season, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Manchester United.
system_output=> One concise fact for the current match could be: Under Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, full-back Alexander-Arnold's overlapping runs and accuracy of crossing have made him a key figure in the team's high pressing style of play.

time=> 2 - 22:29
previous-comments=> Are they about to succumb early in the campaign to an Anfield defeat to West Ham? That's a sloppy from Lovren. He was never in control of that situation.
reference=> He'll be very surprised if he doesn't get booked for that.
system_output=> Despite some ups and downs in his career at Liverpool, Lovren has shown resilience and leadership on the pitch, as seen in his performances and goals during key matches.

time=> 2 - 23:29
previous-comments=> He's getting his head on something. And it's taken short. Tompkins. He's got a right winger tricking him here, I wonder. Not quite. Now he's got to chase Mourinho. He's just presented it straight back to Bayern. Man free inside. Ogbonna.
reference=> Not exactly where you want your centre-back in the number 10 position.
system_output=> Altıntop's impressive free-kick goal in his first game for Bayern Munich showcased his technical excellence and ability to make an impact from long distances.

time=> 2 - 23:39
previous-comments=> Not quite. Now he's got to chase Mourinho. He's just presented it straight back to Bayern. Man free inside. Ogbonna. Not exactly where you want your centre-back in the number 10 position. That's exactly what I was about to say there.
reference=> If you're bringing your centre-backs up for a free kick, why free kick when you play it short?
system_output=> Bayern Munich's Douglas Costa had a fall-out with the club due to lack of playing time under manager Carlo Ancelotti.

time=> 2 - 24:16
previous-comments=> Here is Gomez. There's been a lot of mildew there. Noble, caught by Lucas. And all these little fouls from a Liverpool point of view are just killing any momentum they're trying to build up. He's had a painful afternoon, Noble, but he's done great.
reference=> They've got another difficult one now defending this corner.
system_output=> Lucas' performances in December 2008 for Liverpool drew him much praise from pundits, the highlight being his performance in the 5–1 thrashing of Newcastle United, where he provided an assist for Gerrard.

time=> 2 - 24:22
previous-comments=> He's had a painful afternoon, Noble, but he's done great. Got his body in the way. One free kick just to relieve the pressure. He's done really well there. A real captain's example.
reference=> how you defend set pieces, corners especially, so I'm sure West Ham will still be quite new to it.
system_output=> Noble's leadership and defensive skills have been crucial for West Ham today, just like in his standout performance against Arsenal in the FA Cup fifth-round game.

time=> 2 - 24:32
previous-comments=> He's had a painful afternoon, Noble, but he's done great. Got his body in the way. One free kick just to relieve the pressure. He's done really well there. A real captain's example. Lucas, the latest to be booked. That is a painful...
reference=> At right ankle, Mark Nobles took a fair wet this afternoon.
system_output=> Noble's exceptional performance in the 2007-08 season included scoring the only goal in a 1-0 victory over Liverpool from the penalty spot.

time=> 2 - 25:53
previous-comments=> Here's Lanzini. Trying to smuggle it through to Sacco again. Kouyate looking to place one. And Mignolet behind it all the way. I know we talked about the inexperience on the West End bench, but I'd be interested to see whether or not Jarvis comes on.
reference=> I know Matt very well, blistering pace, whether or not he's still got it because he's had his injury problems, but you certainly think that him on the right wing, you're soaking up the pressure and just give the ball to him as an outlet.
system_output=> Lanzini, who scored the earliest goal in the Superclásico derby, is known for his quick attacking play.

time=> 2 - 27:49
previous-comments=> Not a long way he's come. I remember being at his debut at Villa Park when he played it right back and had an absolutely torrid day, Winston Reid. Massive player for West Ham now, and there he is to win his head.
reference=> He really is, he's a strong man in that back four, and you can obviously see the work that he's done under Sam Allardyce, probably day in, day out, the defensive drills, and he's a real presence back there from now.
system_output=> Winston Reid, who recently departed West Ham United, has made a significant impact on the team's defense throughout his career.

time=> 2 - 29:42
previous-comments=> That's the type of ball you wouldn't mind defending, that floated one. Allows you to get set and go and attack the ball. Must be absolutely delighted, all the West Bank fans who have travelled up here.
reference=> And we said earlier, no history of any positive results at Anfield before.
system_output=> Today's match features a player known for his energetic playing style in midfield and drawing comparisons to Michael Essien.

time=> 2 - 29:49
previous-comments=> Allows you to get set and go and attack the ball. Must be absolutely delighted, all the West Bank fans who have travelled up here. And we said earlier, no history of any positive results at Anfield before.
reference=> Given what happened at Anfield down through the years and what happened already this season, those games against Leicester and Bournemouth, you can imagine none of them counting their chickens just yet.
system_output=> Xabi Alonso scored a crucial goal at Anfield in a big game against Arsenal on November 28, 2004.

time=> 2 - 30:47
previous-comments=> That's the home-time boy carrying the thread here. Corner taken quickly, it's a lovely ball out to Cresswell.
reference=> Seen a nice bit of invention on some of these corners and free kicks from West Ham today.
system_output=> Cresswell has recorded a total of eight assists for West Ham during the 2020-21 season, making him a key playmaker for the team.

time=> 2 - 30:50
previous-comments=> That's the home-time boy carrying the thread here. Corner taken quickly, it's a lovely ball out to Cresswell. Seen a nice bit of invention on some of these corners and free kicks from West Ham today.
reference=> It certainly worked the extra man well on set-pieces.
system_output=> Cresswell has recorded a total of eight assists for West Ham during the 2020-21 season, the most by any full-back in the team.

time=> 2 - 32:29
previous-comments=> Well, the back three has been jettisoned as Jordan Ibe comes on. I think it had to be. It wasn't working. The idea of getting your two wing-backs high and wide didn't affect West Ham one bit.
reference=> It is incredible.
system_output=> Well, speaking of players coming on, Jordan Ibe has shown versatility throughout his career, being able to play as a winger on either flank, as a playmaker, or even as a striker.

time=> 2 - 32:46
previous-comments=> That's the final roll of the dice in terms of substitutes for Brandon Rodgers' nil. Reino Ings and Ibe. His lever lifts it forward towards Benteke, who's still in the yard here on Reid. And where's the support?
reference=> Only had Ings up there with him.
system_output=> One concise fact for live commentary: Ings scored his first Liverpool goal just three minutes after replacing Christian Benteke in a match against Norwich City.

time=> 2 - 33:17
previous-comments=> He was booked in the first half but it seemed to be a straight red that was issued by Kevin Friend there.
reference=> So down to ten aside for the closing 12 minutes past stoppage time, Noble looks absolutely bemused.
system_output=> Despite his early struggles, Schmeichel quickly turned things around and began earning praise for his performances, with his manager comparing him to England's number 1 goalkeeper Joe Hart.

time=> 2 - 33:23
previous-comments=> He was booked in the first half but it seemed to be a straight red that was issued by Kevin Friend there. So down to ten aside for the closing 12 minutes past stoppage time, Noble looks absolutely bemused.
reference=> West Ham are asking... It'll be explaining to him, yes, I gave the foul on Mark Noble, but in your desperation to win the ball before you realise the whistle's gone, he's lunged in.
system_output=> Defoe received a straight red card on 26 December 2010, but his team still managed to secure the win despite playing with ten men for over an hour.

time=> 2 - 33:57
previous-comments=> That's an incredible decision. Oh, his studs are on the ground all the way, it looked like there for Mark Noble. He's stretching, yeah, so it looks like maybe he's not in control, but he is.
reference=> The replay suggests he has cause for grievance here.
system_output=> Mark Noble has scored 25 Premier League penalties, placing him among the top players in the competition for penalty goals.

time=> 2 - 34:00
previous-comments=> That's an incredible decision. Oh, his studs are on the ground all the way, it looked like there for Mark Noble. He's stretching, yeah, so it looks like maybe he's not in control, but he is. The replay suggests he has cause for grievance here.
reference=> It wasn't a case of starting low and raising your boot, which we've seen before.
system_output=> Mark Noble has scored 25 Premier League penalties, showcasing his expertise from the spot.

time=> 2 - 34:18
previous-comments=> It wasn't a case of starting low and raising your boot, which we've seen before. It'd be interesting to know what the referee's view of that was, because if the play was ahead of him, he just sees Martin Noble lunging from behind.
reference=> the fact that he saw it as a straight red as well which it seemed to be i didn't see a flash of his second yellow card and then a red i think the lunge comes for his desperation to close the ball down at no time was he did that seem reckless or going to be a chance there you said there is he's saying he's lunged with two feet well he didn't he didn't lunch with two feet
system_output=> One concise fact for the current match: In a controversial incident, a goal was disallowed for Norwich City after a quick throw-in led to a goal, despite not technically violating any rules.

time=> 2 - 34:39
previous-comments=> 
reference=> That's the one black mark for West Ham today, but can they survive that?
system_output=> And here we have a fun fact for you: Did you know that the team playing today, Nice, had a period of continued success from 2010 to 2013? Let's see if they can channel that success in today's match.

time=> 2 - 34:48
previous-comments=> That's the one black mark for West Ham today, but can they survive that? Falcao for Chelsea as they find a late leveler against Crystal Palace.
reference=> Incredibly, that is West Ham's sixth red card this season alone.
system_output=> In their last meeting, Chelsea secured a late draw against Crystal Palace with a goal from Falcao.

time=> 2 - 34:59
previous-comments=> That's the one black mark for West Ham today, but can they survive that? Falcao for Chelsea as they find a late leveler against Crystal Palace. Incredibly, that is West Ham's sixth red card this season alone. Hooked in by Moreno, away by Reid.
reference=> Sixth in ten games between the Europa League and the Premier League.
system_output=> West Ham has had a total of six red cards this season, making discipline a key issue for the team.

time=> 2 - 36:03
previous-comments=> A day that he'll remember for a long, long time. I was about to say the 11 that's out there, but the 10 that's out there now is about to get even younger, of course.
reference=> This highly talented and highly talented 16-year-old Reece Oxford.
system_output=> Buffon, who spent seventeen years at Juventus, bid farewell to the club in 2018.

time=> 2 - 36:08
previous-comments=> A day that he'll remember for a long, long time. I was about to say the 11 that's out there, but the 10 that's out there now is about to get even younger, of course. This highly talented and highly talented 16-year-old Reece Oxford.
reference=> There weren't rave reviews for his display at the Emirates on the opening day.
system_output=> Reece Oxford made his debut for West Ham United at the age of 16 years and 198 days, becoming the club's youngest ever player.

time=> 2 - 36:11
previous-comments=> This highly talented and highly talented 16-year-old Reece Oxford. There weren't rave reviews for his display at the Emirates on the opening day.
reference=> Leicester game didn't go quite so well when he was taken off at half-time.
system_output=> Reece Oxford holds the record for being West Ham United's youngest ever player, debuting at 16 years and 198 days old.

time=> 2 - 37:25
previous-comments=> He's bailed out by Obiang, he's been terrific today, here's Clyne, and Obiang gets another foot in. Milner sets it there for Ibe, checks back again and Obiang there once more.
reference=> You should be loving this as a defender now, you'd have done this in training, day in day out, attack v defence, just try and break us down, start in good positions, don't be dragged about and that ball will come to you.
system_output=> Milner's versatility and goal-scoring ability have been crucial for his teams throughout his career, as shown by his impressive performances and contract extensions at Newcastle.

time=> 2 - 37:36
previous-comments=> You should be loving this as a defender now, you'd have done this in training, day in day out, attack v defence, just try and break us down, start in good positions, don't be dragged about and that ball will come to you.
reference=> It was a blocked tackle, two players going in wholeheartedly.
system_output=> One concise fact for the current match: The striker on the field today is known for his ability to hold up the ball with his back to goal and bring his teammates into play.

time=> 2 - 38:17
previous-comments=> Here's Milner onto the penalties, but Benteke wins the header and the chance was there for Lovren. What an opportunity. so well Benteke got up early good header down Lovins gotta be scoring there well Benteke will feel he did his bit
reference=> Darren Randolph, as we were saying in the first half, made his Charlton debut, just turned 20 here.
system_output=> Benteke has a history of scoring crucial goals, such as his 92nd-minute equalizer for Liverpool against Chelsea in the 2015-16 season.

time=> 2 - 39:10
previous-comments=> It's forward by O'Bunna. Low-end stand player there. Lovren. Hands with the flick on. You have to say, even though they've gone down to ten, West Ham in their own half have made this Anfield pitch look quite tight today.
reference=> They have, they'll be delighted with their distances between each player in the back four and then the distances between the units to the midfield.
system_output=> Lovren scored his first goal of the season in a 4-0 win over Bournemouth, helping Liverpool become the first team in Premier League history to win four consecutive away league matches by a margin of at least three goals.

time=> 2 - 40:25
previous-comments=> He's fought for everything he's been given, but in terms of the quantity of service that's come his way, it's been lacking today. Sacco's touch. He's got a big heart. I don't think Kevin Friend will be walking off this pitch as an either-side friend today.
reference=> I reckon he'll get a couple of hugs off of the West Ham players if they continue to see out this game 2-0, but it will be looked at again, the sending off certainly of Mark Noble, because it doesn't look like one.

time=> 2 - 40:37

system_output=> Mark Noble has scored 25 Premier League penalties, placing him among the top penalty scorers in the competition.

time=> 2 - 41:18

time=> 2 - 42:15

reference=> they just didn't deal with it well enough and we said listen keep it tight but they didn't and invariably a second goal came along it was always going to be difficult to try and break them down then but just give them something to hold on to and they have done it very well because as we said Randolph hasn't had that much to do

time=> 2 - 44:30
previous-comments=> Jarvis, can he get there? Not quite. That was the perfect out ball for these closing minutes, Matt Jarvis. He did. I'm not quite sure if he's lost a bit because of the injuries he's had recently, but he'll definitely give you that outlet.
reference=> He was unlucky last season, didn't feature a hole-up because of injury.
system_output=> Well, speaking of injuries, it's always tough for players to come back strong after being sidelined. Injuries can really impact a player's form and performance on the field.

time=> 2 - 45:46

time=> 2 - 46:47
previous-comments=> Incredible. I think even with seven minutes remaining, I think they know that that is the final blow to Liverpool. What an incredible day for West Ham. We talked about them being low in confidence and how goals change games, they do, certainly they do.
reference=> But even though they were 2-0 up, there were times they could have gone 3-4, but now to get the third goal, what an incredible result.

system_output=> Fabinho's versatility has been crucial for Liverpool, with his recent performances at centre-back earning praise from pundits and fans alike.

time=> 2 - 48:35
previous-comments=> And I think the man who's been a rock solid at the back today is my man in the match, and that's Winston Reid.
reference=> He has not put a foot wrong today for Slavan Bilic, and an ex-Center back of course will appreciate Reid's performance today, he is Gary Breen's choice as the MSL Motor Group top performer today, Winston Reid.
system_output=> Winston Reid was named captain of the All Whites following the retirement of Ryan Nelsen in 2013.

time=> 2 - 49:22

time=> 2 - 49:27
previous-comments=> Jarvis happy just to play a little bit of keep ball. 7 minutes added on. Liverpool haven't looked like scoring, have they?

system_output=> Jones has been a reliable presence in goal for Liverpool, making key saves in recent matches.

time=> 2 - 50:19
previous-comments=> He's looked like a far better player today than he has over the last couple of games. more like the player we associated with him last year. But you're right, Anfield, there's loads of empty seats at the moment. What is it with West Ham?
